		Since before it appeared on the internet the World of Arl has been host to many crazy inventions. Some of the all time most popular include a giant metal spider with a death ray, a gun that shot across continents, floating cities and flying cities. Such things are both the stuff of legend and at the same time, very much possible in the present.
		<br /><br />

		There are many different types of crazy project, the three most common are Buildings, Military units and Ships (air or sea). I will now explain how to go about starting each project, how you complete it is very dependent on what the project is. At all stages I strongly suggest you talk to me about it, I can provide advice on how to do it and answer questions about things you are unsure of.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addHeading('Amazing buildings'); ?>
		Before you start on your building you need to check that it does not <a href="../nations/constructionFull.php">already exist</a> in functionality. Secondly you need to make sure that your building does not overlap anything else in core function, a building that produces research points will probably not be allowed because they are already produced by universities and academies.
		<br /><br />

		Next, post in your team forum or MSN me about the idea. I'll probably have some questions about the particulars of the building, at some point it'll probably be approved and then you will be given a cost for the building. That's it, you can now build your custom building.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addHeading('Engines of doom'); ?>
		Building a giant robot thing is no easy task but it is possible. You need to work out how to power it and how it will work, you will then have to build a prototype. After it's complete you will get feedback on it's capabilities and production price, you can then either go with it or refine the design and create a new prototype.
		<br /><br />

		The same applies for a floating city or some other creation of your imagination, you simply have to build a prototype (though for really big stuff I'd suggest planning it first) and then when happy with the output, approve it and it'll be added.
