The real power-house of the program, this is what the program was initially
designed for. Players would post orders to a forum, they'd get downloaded and
run through the parser. The parser would generate orders and the orders
executed (if possible). Text results for players and database queries for
the program would be generated all automatically. By hand it took several
hours but by computer it takes a minute or two at most.

It would make more sense if re-writing it to use a parser rather than Regexes.
