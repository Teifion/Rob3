The Greymin grew faster than the Trchig and soon had ports in most of the world and relations with many nations from across the globe. Under the direction of Trchkithin, Bjarth cursed the Greymin and Jaegis was forced to serve as a spy to Trchkithin. The curse has recently been lifted though the memory of it will haunt the Greymin psyche for centuries to come. The Greymin are a reclusive and quiet people, easily drawn to suspect outsiders and shun contact with those they fear to be warlike."""

		"text":		"""Greymin society is quiet and whispered; some might even say mysterious. They believe in personal privacy and the rights of an individual to be secretive even in the home of another, the government has very little power on the micro level and is instead there to ensure society as a whole can function. It's a strange mix of ideologies that would probably fail if not for the strong sense of unity the Greymin share. Their ordeals and subsequent shunning by much of the world have caused Greymin socitety to accept an "us against them" mentality where "them" refers to nearly any outsider.
		<br /><br />

		Society itself is strictly ordered though is not impervious to change. Power and position within the government can wax and wane just like any other, the most noticeable difference though is that as the government has so little power there is very little reason for corruption. The court of Jaegis is non-existant; if the First one takes advice then it is from sources unknown. The Greymin as a whole seem to look to Jaegis not as a leader but more as a guide, he doesn't interfere in their lives and they don't need to worry about what he does, he is simply another Greymin."""

As for Jaegis, he appears to have a set of goals that the nation either know not of or care not about, these goals seem wildly obscure and in some cases completely random."

The Greymin nation is clumsy when it comes to war, their militia non-existant and their tactics simple. They bear little loyalty to the land they stand on and their equalist society makes leadership challenging. Their main defence seems to come in the form of Jaegis himself, his abilities make him a nightmare for any attacking commander and with recent events he has grown stronger still."

They'll happily accept traders into their cities and prefer to assume a neighbour to be an ally rather than a foe. There is however the matter that the Greymin do not share well, allies are often not kept informed about Greymin plans or strategies and with the poor quality of Greymin army it is unlikely that they would provide much help if part of an alliance. Jaegis again operating separately from the nation itself is paranoid and can appear abrasive or even hostile to some. Jaegis can ask for help and often gives a promise of a reward though earning his trust is another matter entirely.",

		With the uprising of the chosen in the last century the Greymin secured allies and moved forwards. Jaegis began to gather many of the Greymin on the Werepysgo islands and around various Chosen nations to safeguard them. At the same time Jaegis met with an old aquantance, Marschaff and the two began to plot the removal of the curse placed upon the Greymin by Bjarth centuries before. The two combined wills to break the curse but something went wrong; the curse broke but cost the lives of tens of thousands of Greymin. In the process Jaegis was also engulfed in power which left him daemonic in nature.
		<br /><br />
		
		Jaegis blamed Marschaff for the problem in breaking the curse and was further angered when Marschaff refused the Greymin refuge on Adothasha. Jaegis eventually managed to secure the aid of more Chosen ones. They fought their way through the traps set out and killed Marschaff. The Greymin now reside on Adothasha alone and content in their security.
		
		<!--
		<br /><br />
		<strong>The return of Trchkithin</strong><br />
		With the return of Trchkithin Jaegis became quieter and did his best to avoid anything that may draw him into the coming conflict. The Greymin as a whole grew more reclusive and fearful as they were present from the earliest days of her last campaign. While publically Jaegis shunned any suggestion of him even fighting Trchkithin he was in private seeking the aid of nations beyond the reach of the chosen. He managed to secure the aid of the Jjaro and even convinced Eldinb to aid the chosen.
		<br /><br />

		When Trchkithin was defeated the Greymin found themselves in a weakened state and collapsed further into solitude. Jaegis' actions during the war secured the aid of Lascha and her Gaschrul, the Greymin relocated their remaining cities onto Bazniraz in the Gaschrul forests and closed their borders. Jaegis is still active within the world working towards whatever aim he has but he's more subdued and cautious now than ever before.
