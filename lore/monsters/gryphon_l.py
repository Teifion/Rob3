		One of our early jobs for Reeth was to attain for him some Gryphon eggs. I had regularly heard tales of attacks by such creatures along the trade routes near to a favourite tavern of mine, of the eagle-headed monsters dropping from the sky onto unsuspecting caravans, where they would devour livestock and any merchants unfortunate enough to find themselves trapped there.<br />
		<tab>It took us a meagre few days to reach the area, where we stayed in the old inn; the barmaid had changed since my last visit, making the night before we set out all the more enjoyable. At Anna's uncharacteristic insistence we left before first light, making good time into the hills that the creatures were known to live in. My stealthy friend has always acted strangely, and it is when she make these demands for haste that I worry most about her past; but then, I am sure I could fill a second journal with the eccentricities of my companions.<br />
		<tab>In the wooded highlands, we spotted our first gryphon after just a few days, a distant speck in the sky. As we walked, Mekhvitz explained to me that such large fliers were thought to ride high on unseen winds, as if the earth itself was blowing them away from it, for their wings weren't strong enough to beat them into the air with their own power unlike some of the smaller animals we had come across in our travels.<br />
		<tab>Over the next few days the winged beasts were often visible through the trees at a great distance, in ones and twos. Gerard tells me that he could make out two fighting, and that it was fearsome; if it wasn't for how little he speaks to us, I might have put this down as an exageration, for all I saw was two dark shapes together in the sky. They could have been mating, for all I know.<br />
		<tab>We found the nest halfway down a sheer cliff, hidden on a ledge, and settled to pillaging it. With Gerard taking overwatch, as usual, we set to rapelling down the stoney face. While Mekhvitz and I held her rope, Anna disappeared from sight, one of the Avowed's smaller crossbows loaned to her strapped to her, the tip coated in some of Mekhvitz's poison. <br />
		<tab>I didn't see her shot, but I heard the female gryphon's muffled cry as it fell into unconsciousness. Satisfied that she'd be ready, I lowered down the basket we'd brought, and felt the weight of one egg, and then another, get added to it; who'd have thought a few baby birds would be so heavy?<br />
		<tab>When I was close to getting the basket back to the top, that's when things became worse. The male of this nest landed, and had I not been too busy holding both the lovely Anna and the eggs up, I might have been overwhlemed by the creature's majesty; as it was, I was somewhat distracted. With its front legs those of the eagle which it so much resembled, and its back half akin to a mighty lion, it was a strange beast.<br />
		<tab>Mekhvitz probably didn't have a chance to appreciate this though, as it charged into him, clawing with its eagle's talons, and leaping from the clifftop, grappling together. Before I even heard the shot strike its target, I knew Gerard would fire. We later found out that he'd only narrowly missed Mehkvitz's arm, much to the Trchig's annoyance.<br />
		<tab>With both our doctor and the male gryphon from sight, we chose to secure Anna and the eggs, before continuing.
		<tab>When we eventually found Mekhvitz, at the bottom of the cliff with a broken leg, and a dead gryphon, he was not pleased.
