		<?php echo addHeading('A brief summary'); ?>
		When Arl formed the 9th world he added more races to it. Previously he had only placed Chosen Ones (humans) onto his worlds, they were gifted with great individuality but at the cost of great conflict. With the 9th world Arl first created other races before bringing in the Chosen Ones from past worlds. The older races are thus called the "First ones", these first ones are led by a First One. When the First One dies and is not brought back by magic they stay dead.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addHeading('Location, location and location'); ?>
		<img src="../../images/nations/irMap.png" alt="" width="237" height="233" style="float: right;"/>
		Each Indigenous Race (IR) has two attributes above all; activity and might. These are determined by their start position; the races on the equator are complete pushovers while the ones at the north and south pole are near unkillable. The further south you go, the more active the races, the more that they will interact with the Chosen One nations, be it in a friendly or unfriendly manner.
		<br /><br />

		Simply put, you can choose how much interaction you have with these races by where you start your team.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addSubHeading('Might'); ?>
		This is simply how much damage they can deal; a team can be small yet mighty because it is very proficient at war or many but with no stomach for war. There are two lines on the map called teamwork lines, they run at approximately 1,000 and 3,000 on the Y coordinate. Anything above 1,000 (top half of the northern hemisphere) or below 3,000 (southern half of the southern hemisphere) will <em>probably</em> require teamwork to take down. Of course, tougher targets have bigger prizes.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addHeading('Artifacts'); ?>
		Risk can bring reward, the reward in question is that of one or more ancient artifacts. These artifacts are tied into the culture of the race and though the race in question may not benefit from the artifact, it will be similar to them. Thus the Cayim Amiy did not have an artifact related to war. When you take the artifact, you can use it or sell it, it's up to you. Of course, when you have an artifact other people will know that you have it and you will become a bigger target because of it.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addHeading('Powers'); ?>
		Each first one leader is a being of great power, they are faster, stronger and tougher than Chosen One leaders and also have a special power, sometimes they have more than one. When you kill a first one, you get these special powers, anybody that kills you then takes them from you and you can take them back, should you die and there not be a Chosen that organised your death nearby, you will keep your powers. You can give them up voluntarily too if you so wish and thus can sell them or gift them to allies.
		<br /><br />

		Each power also has a "duplicate" value, when you take the power in the first place you may have copies of it, you gain no benefit to having the copies (they will all be taken at your death) so you can give/sell them to other chosen should you be that way inclined.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addHeading('Self sufficient'); ?>
		The IR follow slightly different rules to the player teams, they do not have the quick pace of development and as such are considered to be self-sufficient. Armies will be replaced for free as long as they do not lose the city that they came from. Conversely however their armies will never grow to above a certain size and thus you lose nothing biding your time when dealing with the less active IRs. The more active ones however will use this regenerating army to strike at those near them.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addHeading('The edge of the map'); ?>
		Along the West (left) and East (right) side of the globe, the IR's exist outside of the normal activity and might restrictions. They do however have a series of connected events about them, they have a story that you influence, an objective that you can help or hinder them with as you see fit. Before you embark on the story, you will be told Out of Character (OOC) by the GM that that is what is being offered to you so that you cannot accidentally blunder into them.
