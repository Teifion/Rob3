He will sit quite contently with his tools, mixing powders, adding oils and acids, and generally doing whatever else his alchemy involves. I have long learnt to keep my distance, as his calculations are sometimes less than precise.<br />
		<tab>It was with such trepidation that I watched him digging holes, shaving clay from explosives, and gently burying them again. He must have repeated it a dozen times, before he gingerly crossed to us, the sand shifting beneath his booted feet.<br />
		<tab>Quite unusually, all four of us agreed on the reliance upon explosives. With the information that Mekhvitz had read, and the reports Anna brought back to us, we saw little other choice.<br />
		<tab>Despite the beast's lair having been known for months, none of the local tribes and towns had ever stood a chance at ousting it; this fortunately made it relatively easy to find.<br />
		<tab>Anna drew its attention with a well thrown flash, some horrid smoke pouring out as the glass shattered on the huge lizard's scaly back; we'd already heard enough tales to know it would do little good in itself, but our girl knows how to move quickly, even over the shifting sands. From my own hiding place, I watched its long sinewy neck track round to her, snap its needle-lined jaws, before pushing after her on its four legs over the dunes. Fortunately my part in this plan had been to follow after Anna and the Hydra, so I was lucky enough to not arrive on the scene until after the trap had been sprung; that's not to say I didn't hear the reverberating thunder of a score of the Avowed's munitions exploding in symphony.<br />
		<tab>By the time I climbed up what was left of the dune - its once high sandy top having levelled out, burying much of the remains of the beast - the hydra was down, little more than sand-covered chunks of flesh was all that was left. I'd seen Mekhvitz swinging an axe before, chopping firewood or in preparation for some sort of plan, but it was still somewhat alien to see him with one in his hands instead of his more common array of short blades and claws. The Trchig must have been busy hacking into what was left of the hydra when I arrived, while Gerard lay a short distance away, a crossbow cradled in his arms, trained on the bloody mess. Anna was nowhere to be seen.<br />
		<tab>I don't recall much of what happened next, just fragments. The main bulk of the hydra's 'corpse' must have moved, because I know Mekhvitz was thrown backwards. And Gerard must have hit the creature's head as it went to bite him, but I'm sure a long neck had turned round to snap at me as well. Maybe when I dodged those needle-like teeth I hit my head harder than I thought, because normally dead creatures don't get back up, and I don't think there are many monsters that I've met which have a swarm of heads like this thing did.<br />
		<tab>When I came too later, the others refused to explain to me just what had happened. Recalcitrant bastards.
