		The Kingdom of Cadia was rare amongst those nations that opposed Trchkithin during the days of the Trchig Invasions, choosing to combat the might First One's armies and magicks by themselves, too proud to accept others in allies. Though they succeeded in bloodying their enemy's nose on more than one occasion, their arrogance ultimately proved their downfall, as they were outnumbered and eventually overran.
<br />

		In the early days of the war a call to arms was issued to every able bodied man, and thousands responded, beating pruning hooks into spears and ploughs into swords, until a mighty army was formed. A valuable resource was missed though in this time, that being the willful Cadian women; despite this, dozens, if not hundreds, attempted to join the legion, cutting their hair and stuffing their breeches to remain close to their loved ones, to better serve and protect them. Only a handful of women-at-arms lasted in the army, the majority quickly being found out and sent home to their stoves.
<br />

		Adyl was one such woman, following her sweetheart to war, her once soft heart hardening, forging its own armour when her lover's blood was splashed across her armour. Taking his sword in hand, she remained in the army, going on to fight in dozens of skirmishes and battles against Trchkithin, cursing the First One's name with every swing of her blade. In all this time no one caught on to her true sexuality, her strength and sense of loyalty turning her into the epitome of the Cadian army.
<br />

		In a few short years she gained great recognition for her bravery, leaping into the breach and holding the line countless times, and was knighted by her King. Still carrying her dead lover's longsword, hammered and sharpened countless times, she continued to fight the good fight, gaining dozens of minor victories against Trchkithin's war engine, gaining her the favour of her liege.
<br />

		But with the rise of this young warrior, so too rose political rivals to Adyl, threatened by the titles and priveleges that the Royal house showered upon her. Seeking dark secrets and past indiscretions to blackmail her with, these nobles quickly came upon her one true secret, that she was no man-at-arms at all. It did not take long for them to present their evidence to His Majesty. 
<br />

		Adyl was brought before the king, jeers and insults accompanying the accusations and testimonies in a long and tedious trial, with many traditionalists calling for the knights head. His Majesty merely nodded as his sycophants spouted their self righteousness, eventually raising a hand. With a wry smile on his face, he pronounced her innocent of the many trumped up charges, and returned her sword to her.
<br />

		It was not long before she was once more on the front lines, her battalions slowly being forced back by Trchkithin herself. In a desperate gamble she led her closest followers in a counterattack, striking hard and fast at Trchkithin's base camp, slaughtering hundreds in their charge. The First One herself answered, entering single combat with the lady knight. Adyl escaped, bloodied and bruised, by the skill of her swordarm and the luck that her soldiers had lacked, each of them cut down to the man.
<br />

		In an attempt at redemption she sought out a coven of sorcerers, drawing on their magicks to heal her wounds, and returned to stand in the Trchig Army's path, a single figure, her long dead lover's bladein weary hand, ready to face them down. As they approached she called out the First One, demanding a duel for the fate of her beloved kingdom. Trchkithin agreed with a smile, walking towards her foe with her own greatsword in hand, terrifying sorceries wreathing it in multi-hued flames. 
<br />

		The two blades had no chance to meet, Trchkithin merely lifting her sword in one hand and stretching out with the other, opening a dozen tiny rents to some foreign world all around Adyl, tearing her apart. Smiling, she ordered the advance.
<br />
		But Adyl's tale did not end on that blood soaked killing field. In her many years of service to the crown the common people came to know her name and her story, naming her a saint and a saviour, despite her eventual failings. As Trchkithin's army razed Cadia, their voices cried out to her, the choir of dying prayers tugging at her lost spirit, drawing it back to Arl's world.
<br />

		Seeing the loss of her homeland, Adyl did nothing so weak as shedding a tear, and instead drew upon her new found power, creating a sword. The knight would ride again.
