I had experienced all these things before, in one locale or another, but it was the attach on our camp that has left me so shaken. It was nearly as bad as that incident when leaving Magalanischk.<br />
		<tab>Some of the mountainfolk - a stunted, primitive people - had warned us before we left them, of monsters that came from the shadows, dragging away their most fearsome hunters to be devoured in caves littered with bones. Mekhvitz had laughed derisively at the man that had told us this tale, and, in hindsight, I am somewhat ashamed of the fact that I joined him in such mockery.<br />
		<tab>It was our third night away from 'civilisation' when it happened. During my watch on that snow covered mountain side, when they came. Perhaps I was resting my eyes for a moment in the darkness, or maybe the creatures lulled me into sleep - whatever occurred, I came to only to discover our campfire had died down, and then I was hit in the head with a rock.<br />
		<tab>My cry must have awoken my companions, for Anna was quickly at my side, deflecting a blow from a towering humanoid armed with a crude club using nothing but her own arms. Despite the skill I had seen her use countless times before, that strike must have hurt, for she staggered back for the briefest of moments before kicking through the monster's knee. It howled as it fell to the ground, before Anna swung one of those shapely legs of hers, and kicked it in the head.<br />
		<tab>As several more of the creatures appeared amongst us in the dark, the thrum of Gerard's arbalest-string was a welcome sound. The munition he must have thrown a moment later, for the mountainside was briefly illuminated as if by thunder and lightning, was slightly less welcome, but it sent several of the creatures scurrying away, knuckles dragging through the fresh snow.<br />
		<tab>I was surely stunned by that first mighty blow, for I was unable to rise to assist my friends in our defence, my falchion lying in its sheath beside me.<br />
		<tab>I had long come to know Mekhvitz's fighting style, with his short blades cutting tendon and muscle to debilitate a foe, and was shocked, as he started slicing up the third creature, to see the first one struggle upright again. It still bled, but it was able to stand. Gerard's shot, through its neck, seemed to put it down with a degree of certainty though.<br />
		<tab>It had looked like that could have been the end of our journey for a moment there, but Anna, bless her hide, saved us. A lit torch in each hand, she drove the creatures away, shouting and waving them above her head until the flames seemed solid.<br />
		<tab>We did not sleep much the rest of that night.<br />
		<tab>When the morning finally came with its weak, grey light, we examined the corpses of the meagre two that had the decency to remain dead. If not for the spilled blood and the marked snow, I might have thought we had dreamt of them in such numbers.<br />
		<tab>Despite my none too impressive intellect, I will not pretend to understand what Mekhvitz told us then about the huge humanoid creatures and their fearsome looks that we met that night, but he spoke of trolls that he had read of in several books, having believed they were little more than stories. If only he had been right.<br />
