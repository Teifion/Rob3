The lists were simply the lists of items (spells, techs, deities etc) that
were used in the game, they were stored in Python scripts and synced to the
database automatically by running the "cli.py sync" command. It just made
it easier for me to maintain, a better method would be to just save them
straight to the database I suppose.
