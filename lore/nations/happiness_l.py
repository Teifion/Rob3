Happiness is defined by many things, a leader that issues edicts that satisfy their people, buildings that satisfy the populace and avoidance of prolonged wars being just a few of the things. On the other hand fermenting unhappiness within the people of a foe can spark disloyalty, riots and rebellion."""

All people naturally want to be happy and start happy, as the cities become larger and larger they start to get crowded and this happiness can be overcome. Cities 'break even' on happiness at 40,000 people. It's at this point that modifiers such as being built on a supply, wealth, surplus and the like become useful as do traits."""

A warlike nation becomes unhappy with prolonged periods of peace and if their leader is unable to find new conquests for them then he can expect to be replaced by somebody that can. A nation with state religion will be happier as long as their deity is happy but should the deity become unhappy then this will quickly affect the people too."""
