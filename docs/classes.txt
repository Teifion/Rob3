Classes are normally a direct mapping to their database schema which is
also a direct mapping to their in-game use. It makes for a hard to-test
program but when I started it 4 years ago testing wasn't what I cared about.

Each file contains normally 1 class and then information for any sub-tables
such as linking buildings to their cities.

I am particularly happy with the res_dict class and anybody thinking of making
a similar game may want to have a look at this. It is designed to act like a
numerical type and allow you to apply addition, subtraction and suchlike to
resource pools.

Res_dicts are stored as strings and allow you to define conditional costs
such as weapons costing less if you have a supply of iron but also swappable
costs such as being able to use normal magic points in place of specific ones.
