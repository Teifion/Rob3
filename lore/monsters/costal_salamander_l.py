		<tab>We passed our time in tavern after tavern, and village after village, offering our services to whichever local group needed them. It was pretty poor paying compared to some of the jobs we've had, but the gratitude they paid was without price, if only because it meant they would be less likely to sell us out to someone following us. I think that plan worked as well as can be expected.<br />
		<tab>It was in such a coastal village, a pitiful place of a few dozen sullen families huddling in the meagre shelter offered by a deep cove, that we were hired for this particular task. We'd stopped raiders for merchants and mayors before then, and have probably repelled such groups since then as well, but few were quite so unique as the men and women that we experienced here. The locals had been terrorised by this gang for several years, the bandits returning at the turn of the autumn tides to pillage their harvest for the winter.<br />
		<tab>The village's spokesperson told us that they had always come to the settlement in the same way, swarming up the beach near their sea-damp quays, cutting down any poor fisherman that was unfortunate enough to stand in their wide path. Armed with such information, we prepared ourselves, and laid a trap.<br />
		<tab>Night eventually came, as did our targets. I hid in some ancient upturned barrel, half submerged in the sand, in a flanking position, while the others took their cover on the near edge of the village. It shocked me to see them pull up onto the beach, not in shallow-bottomed boats like we had planned for, but upon the back of some long, low, quadrupeds. In the poor light I am not quite sure how to describe them - easily twice the length of a normal man, with a blunt head at one end a long tapering tail at the other. A lightly armoured brigand appeared above the surf with each one, followed by the strange, amphibious mount that each rode.<br />
		<tab>Too late to change Mekhvitz's careful strategy, or to simply flee, we continued with the plan.<br />
		<tab>Anna appeared in the central street before them, a lantern above her head, illuminating her slender features. I heard the sea-men laugh at the possibility of such a prize; if they hadn't turned out to be such cruel bastards, I'd have felt pity for what they were about to chase down. Their steeds moved quickly, showing a burst of speed to match even the fastest warhorse over the loose sand and onto the dirt-lined lanes between village houses. Their legs, seemingly far too frail to hold up their barded bodies and the steel-clad men upon their backs, flailed as they moved, long tails whipping through the air snake-like behind them and blunt mouths open wide.<br />
		<tab>Our girl disappeared down one of the roads, three of them following her quickly. I heard the one of them let out a guttural, high-pitched shriek as they reached Mekhvitz; the plan had been for him to jump the men had they been on foot, but how he managed to wade in amongst the trio and bring them down, I'm not quite sure. Another pair moved to intercept the Trchig at the noise, but they fell from their mounts almost simultaneously. Gerard still won't tell me if he was using more than one weapon, or if he has just mastered reloading. Either way, he peppered the nearest amphibian with shots, causing it to shriek like the others before felling it.<br />
		<tab>I came out from my hiding place as the last raider was lured in to the village, where they would find roads barricaded, and locals armed with their fishing and hunting tools. It was my job to push the cart across the open street to prevent their escape, but I found a pair of them rushing back, attempting to free themselves from the ambush. <br />
		<tab>The first raised a bow and fired, his arrow missing by a hair's breadth as his mount moved beneath him. His partner charged me, and I skillfully dodged, catching the beast and rider with my falchion. Its tip tore through unprotected flesh, and I heard again the wild screech that these huge salamanders unleashed, along with the man upon it shouting angrily. Limping, they disappeared into the surf behind me.<br />
		<tab>I didn't manage to dodge the second ranged attack, as the demonic newt drew back its wide head and spat. Thick, dark, mucus struck me across my chest. It smelt of dead fish, salt, and something like that home brewed spirit that we tried when with the Shefair.<br />
		<tab>It was horrifying, the things that came to my mind's eye. Creatures that clawed at my peripheral vision, an inability to rationalise the things that I saw, and swirling colours that attempted to devour me. I have experienced hallucinogens before, had glamours cast upon me, and fought terrors across Arl's world, but few things quite like this.<br />
		<tab>By the time I had recovered, my comrades had chased away the surviving corsairs. I remembered little of it, but they regaled me with tales of the bandit leader, and the creature he had ridden. I am glad to have not seen it; nearly thirty feet long, and it apparently continued to thrash and fight even after two of Gerard's quarrels were sticking out of its skull."""
