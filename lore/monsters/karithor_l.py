		<tab>Anna had tracked the beast for several moons, following Mekhvitz' instructions based upon his reading - he might still unnerve me to this day, but he knows how to find the right book for a job, I'll give him that. Her stalking though had narrowed down its current whereabouts, until we knew where to find it.<br />
		<tab>It was Mekhvitz' who sourced the bait; to this day I know not what it was, nor where he got it from. In all honesty, I would rather not know its origin, but whatever it was the beast smelt it from miles away, if Anna is to be believed, for she tells me that the karithor she had hunted, a bull male, had made its way towards us as soon as it was laid out. The trap had been set.<br />
		<tab>Despite Mekhvitz' literature on the subject, and the few images that Anna brought up for us, my surprise when I first gazed upon the karithor was great. It was larger than I had even dreamed, easily twice the height of even Gerard, loping towards our trap on its hind legs, great forearms occasionally impacting into the ground as it kepts its balanced. It sat hunched over its prize, that strange meat, and between clumsy mouthfuls kept its head up; I shudder to this day wondering what greater predator it may have been watching for, for such things surely do not belong in our natural world.<br />
		<tab>When it eventually finished its meal, sucking meat from its fingers in an all too human fashion, it rose. And that was when Gerard unleashed his shot.<br />
		<tab>I am sure he had spent days choosing his hiding place, finding the right line of sight, preparing for adverse weather, or whatever it is he does when he disappears for days before we finish a job. I'll never match that Avowed's patience.<br />
		<tab>The poison on that bolt, fired from the largest of his many bows and arbalests, must have penetrated the thick hide we had been warned against, for after the karithor's terrifying, rageful roar, it staggered from side to side as if drunk. I am sure that Mekhvitz must have provided him with some drug for that shot, for I have never known our Avowed friend to carry poisons himself.<br />
		<tab>The beast went to flee then, and I watched the almost artistic second shot from the treeline, a flaming arrow landing in the grass not ten feet from the karithor. Flames leapt up on all sides, trapping it.<br />
		<tab>Perhaps the laugh that escaped my throat as Anna threw an ineffective bolas in some attempt to entangle its legs was not the most diplomatic thing I could have done at that point; she certainly ensured that I paid for that indiscretion later.<br />
		<tab>As the beast stumbled back in fear, ignoring the bolas around its one leg, I watched as Mekhvitz leapt in, narrowly dodging a mighty swing that left grooves in the ground, to swing some strange curved weapon in both hands. Compared to his usual surgical work it was almost brutish, but it had the desired effect.<br />
		<tab>Leg crumpling beneath it, the monster attempted another swing, raising one arm to strike at the Trchig; Mekhvitz was lucky for Gerard's support, another heavy bolt penetrating the hide at the centre of its palm, stalling it for a second as the cruel weapon was swung again, disabling its other leg.<br />
		<tab>Rising from my own hiding place, I approached the flaming trap cautiously as Mekhvitz swung again and again, slicing tendons and muscles, until the beast was disabled.<br />
		<tab>The difficulties that we faced in transporting such a prize back to Reeth can wait for another time - I hear Gerard coming.<br />
