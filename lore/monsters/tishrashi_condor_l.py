Mekhvitz had spoken of the place with some familiarity, having come through here many years before meeting us, and had described the place vividly. He span surprisingly imageful tales of the exotic goods there, and the comraderie that appeared there amongst the many travelling traders as they crossed the sand-sea.<br />
		<tab>It was not as he described.<br />
		<tab>Gerard was the first to spot the distant spiral of thin smoke on the horizon. I had to take his few terse words for it for several more miles, relying on his eagle's eyes as we had done for so long. Once it was in sight I then had the misfortune of riding alongside Mekhvitz, and having to put up with his theories on what was causing it. Not who might have set fire to such a place, mind you, but rather what combination of wood, cloth, oil, and all other manner of refuse might produce a smoke of such colour and consistency.<br />
		<tab>As it turned out most of the camp was in a pristine, if somewhat panicked and sandy, condition. We arrived slightly before the rest of the caravan - other minor merchants, who must have been glad for our 'protection' - and Anna quickly disappeared in amongst the dark skinned locals. I recall the groups of tents, each cluster close to the banks of the waterhole, and the chaotic stream of men and women moving between them.<br />
		<tab>She reappeared a short while later, some pilfered local foodstuff, a chunk of meat wrapped in strange leaves, in her hands, with news that the desert folk were talking of 'flying demons' that had come down from the mountains, and had stolen their livestock. I think it must have been Mekhvitz who pointed out that demons aren't usually known for their love of camels, and suggested that it must have been something relatively mundane. Not that it mattered, as it turned out. <br />
		<tab>After resupplying we continued onwards, thinking no more of the blood on the sand, and those upturned tents. This turned out to be a mistake.<br />
		<tab>When that huge shadow passed over us, I fell from my saddle, glimpsing in the harsh light Anna simply freeze and disappear, as Mekhvitz shouted something to the rest of the caravan. I was unable to see him from my precarious angle, but by the time I was upright again Gerard had drawn and strung a huge bow.<br />
		<tab>It returned, sharp talons tearing through a camel, lifting the body and flying away with it. A few arrows struck the sand in its wake, the Avowed marksman holding his string taut still, but it was Mekhvitz's thrown bolas that brought it down. It's sometimes easy to forget how much strength there is between him and Gerard, those two giants amongst men, but then one of them does something like this...<br />
		<tab>Anna appeared at my side, sprinting across the shifting sand towards the screaming heap of bloody feathers. I heard rather than saw the bird snap at her, before she finished it. By the time I reached the huge corpse, all three of my companions had gathered around it, Mekhvitz brutishly retreiving the ropes that had wrapped around its one wing. Gerard was still scanning the sky, while Anna was fiddling with a long dark feather.<br />
		<tab>Though it was hard to tell from the haphazard heap before us, the one outstretched wing was of gargantuan length, easily thirty feet long, and strong enough to keep aloft its not-inconsiderate body and the camel it had siezed. <br />
		<tab>The Trchig slowly explained to us that the beast looked half-starved, and that between its comparatively short talons and bald, featherless head, it would usually eat carrion. Desperation had forced the poor beast to turn to preying on what creatures it could - a few poor camels and oxen it would seem. I'm not sure if I was horrified or curious when he drew out a hefty scalpel-like blade, and began to cut through its chest, and began to discuss, with no one inparticular, the relatively weak flight muscles and how it must have remained airborne. I still don't know what a 'thermal' is.<br />
		<tab>We saw no more of these birds as we crossed the desert in search of Deiderik, but we ate well for many nights. I think it tasted sort of like a dirty turkey, but the others did not agree."""
