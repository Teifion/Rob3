Their origins are said to be tied to those of the ancestor of the chosen themselves, the Cheroic. Jjaro scholars have compared their earliest records with those of the Cayim Amiy and found that they almost certainly arrived before Trchkithin began her first campaign, around the same time as the Greymin were making acquaintances across the globe."""

The nation is a democracy but in theory only, the people care so little about their rulers that the ruling class have maintained a grip on power for over a thousand years. That said the rulers are mostly fair, they carve themselves a larger slice of the monetary pie certainly but they appease the people enough that nobody notices and those that do either don't care enough or get brought into the fold.
		<br /><br />

		The common levels of society spend their days working and trying to find new ways to do things, most of them fail and there have been times in the past were radical ideas have caused famine, disease and once even war. The champions of the people are the inventors and magicians who are most successful, with his expert grasp on animation Drinniol has been ever-popular hence why he is still "in power".

They seek to try new things and experiment in new ways, they call it science and mental exploration, others call it madness. The chaotic and unfocused 'exploration' of the Jjaro has caused friction with neighbours before as the Jjaro generally perform experiments without requesting permission or considering possible fallout.",

He's far from a strategist though who he delegates to is not known. Though it is far from sharp the Jjaro military is well equipped and backed by the creations of the Jjaro. In the last war the Jjaro directly caused Drinniol personally led deadly contraptions against the foe of the Jjaro and dueled their leaders for the fates of cities.

As Trchkithin was reborn the Jjaro had a number of years of fortune and found themselves beseeached for aid by several other nations including the Greymin. Drinniol is thought to have said yes out of shock of having Jaegis ask him for help.
		<br /><br />

		When the armies of Trchkithin came west to Adothasha they encountered the Jjaro alongside the Greymin and others, Drinniol strove to out-do Jaegis though Trchkithin herself was not present in the West. When the invaders were repulsed the Jjaro found that their islands had been hit by flanking forces and since there was room elsewhere they decided to move.""",
