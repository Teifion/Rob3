		Arl, the great Arl, did not create all the Worlds but he did form the Worlds of Arl. His first 8 works were all failures, the worlds were too small and fell apart on themselves, he carried the beings of each world onto the next world that he created, they became the Chosen Ones. Finally he created the 9th World of Arl.
		<br /><br />

		Arl grasped at the emptiness and shaped out of it the Sun that shines light and life on the World of Arl. Arl rejoiced as he seeded the world with life, he placed all the people onto this world of his. There were many races, from the great and mighty Magal to the long lived Cayim Amiy. The nations rejoiced at their life and explored the mysteries that until now had been only at the grasp of the "Chosen ones".
		<br /><br />

		After more than a hundred years of peace, the looming shadow of war arrived. Many of the nations squabbled with their neighbours but war on this scale had not been seen before, nor would it be seen for some time. Onlod the leader of the Carneti began to grow his nation and sought to push everybody else from out of his path. Arl responded by opening portals to the previous worlds he had created and the Chosen ones poured through.
		<br /><br />

		<?php
			echo addSubHeading('The immortals');

		Onlod was not a master tactician but had a huge advantage of numbers and managed to surround the Chosen ones on the island of Rayti. Enter the Cayim Amiy, a great and large nation who never reached old age, never became sickly ill and were many in number themselves. Though peaceful they were adept at war in these times and managed to shelter the Chosen ones while driving the Carneti off to the west.
		<br /><br />

		The Chosen Ones prospered in quiet, biding their time and diverging in interests. While this was happening there was another war to the south. Trchkithin by luck, skill, fear and wisdom managed to conquer her way to the Cayim Amiy.
		<br /><br />

		<?php echo addSubHeading('Godhood'); ?>
		On her way to the North, Trchkithin progressed along the path of the daemonic and when finally defeated by Bithpie managed to seek refuge in the world of Enkhingi, her body destroyed and her power reduced to that of a spirit. The Trchig survivors chased south by some of the Chosen Ones whom to this day have never returned.
		<br /><br />

		The world rests in a semblance of peace everywhere except Ryati. Here the Chosen Ones have decided that their time has come and that they can lay claim to any piece of land they wish. The question is, can they?
