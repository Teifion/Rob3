This is not some simple and cliched nation, you are not a menacing orc or pointy eared elf, it's a nation created to be exactly what you want it to be. You can of course be a menacing orc but you can also be nearly anything else that your imagination can think of. On this world walk the other nations, you decide how you interact with them and why, you decide if you declare war or if an alliance is to be formed.
		<br /><br />

		It is not all about invading other people's nations. The World of Arl is a friendly and close-knit community; some even say that the community is better than the game itself! Though the game takes a lifetime to master it takes only a little while to learn and even less to get started. If you're already convinced that you want to play then I suggest moving on to the <a href="pages/general/starting.php">getting started</a> page and take it from there."""

World of Arl is designed to allow choice and freedom of imagination, if you have a catapult that shoots fire then you can set fire to things with it. Here's a list of just some of the things you can do in the game.
		<br /><br />
		
		<ul>
			<li>Evolve your race from humanity into something else</li>
			<li>Assassinate the enemy leader, then impersonate them</li>
			<li>Start riots in an enemy city</li>
			<li>Create an Earthquake</li>
			<li>Alter the weather</li>
			<li>Starve an opposing nation</li>
			<li>Poison a food supply and incriminate someone else</li>
		</ul>

		That's just a taster of what you can do, I would have put in more things but there's so much to pick from and I have only so much space to list them in. Your choice of what you can do is often limited only by your imagination."""
