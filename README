Rob is a program used to help run the turn based game WoA (http://woarl.com)
This code is being made available as the game is no longer running
and the code is completely unmaintained but is free to use where it suits
your needs, I would be grateful for attribution should you do so.

It was never written with the intent to share so comments are few and far
between.

The program requires Python 3 and has two entry points, cli.py and web.py

The web.py was used behind the standard OSX Apache install with a localhost
URL pointing all queries towards it. exec.py is similar to web.py but is
intended for anything where you will want to redirect out of the page
such as inserting a player (so you don't dual insert).

cli.py is the main front-end for running automated scripts, running cli.py h
will output a list of the most common modes used, one of the most common was
to upload static versions of some files (WoA was hosted on shared hosting
with account limits).

**More coming later**
