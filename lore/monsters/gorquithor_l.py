The way water dripped from outstretched pine needles felt almost like a lover's kiss the first time it struck my skin, a symphony of sensation on an upturned palm, but when I'd been there for weeks, drops running down the back of my neck and water seeping into every set of clothes I had, it started to get old, quickly.<br />
		<tab>Actually, I remember a bit more than that. I think it was Reeth who'd asked us to find for him a gorquithur; he told us of a man he'd met who had trained one, and the amusement he'd gained from it. It was odd, now that I think about it, that we went through with this job when he [i]asked[/i] us for it; I really don't recall what our payment for it was, and favours and respect don't stop a stomach from rumbling.<br />
		<tab>We met our first of these creatures having been in those high forests for only a few days, when a huge male attacked us. The first we knew of it was the cracking of trees to one side, before it bowled into Mekhvitz, taking him to the ground and attempting to maul him. He managed to hold the beast's huge jaws, full of snapping teeth, at bay long enough for Gerard to barrel into its side, swinging one of his crossbows round like a club, knocking it back long enough for our Trchig friend to escape unscathed. The weather had wreaked havoc with his bowstrings, and with the ignition powders and acids for his munitions - his usual approach was useless here.<br />
		<tab>Anna saved us, hoisting one of the Trchig's oversized bolas and swinging it with surprising strength. It flew through the air, catching the gorquithur around the head, whipping its snout around and away from us. The grace she used in leaping onto its back was impressive, but perhaps not as awing the coordination between her and Mekhvitz; such cooperation between those two is uncommon to say the least. As she pulled the bear-like monster's head back, he came to his feet quick, lashing out at its neck several times. The noises it made as it thrashed about, dying slowly from a crushed windpipe, were the things nightmares are made of. <br />
		<tab>Mekhvitz tended to his own wounds, stitching and bandaging himself up with barely a grunt of pain. I think I laughed at the silent exchange between him and Gerard, as he refused the Avowed's own basic first aid. Though it was quite safely dead, it was still an unsettling thing to study, the gorquithur. It reminded me somewhat of the plains bear we'd hunted months before, with the same powerful limbs and short, wicked-looking claws, but much larger. Had it stood upright, on its trunk-like rear legs, it would have easily been twenty feet in height, but its core was disproportionately lighter. Perhaps that was how Anna managed to straddle it.<br />
		<tab>Ragged boney plates protruded out from between its coarse fur, covering much of its body with a suit of grey natural armour. Had Mekhvitz aimed anywhere other than the gorquithur's neck, he would have had a hard time getting through, and we could have all died in that forest. What a morose thought.<br />
		<tab>In that wet woodland we met more gorquithurs several weeks later, hearing the baying and fighting long before we saw them. A mother and her cubs - I call them cubs, but each was easily the size of a normal forest bear - were in a clearing, a pack of qenki wolves circling them. Several of the dire hounds already lay dead, the mother's claws caked in drying blood; even one of young creatures had scored a kill, its boney muzzle stained red.<br />
		<tab>We watched as the wolves circled them, one or two luring the adult gorquithur out while others would close with her young; it was unfortunate for the pack that their intended prey were perfectly capable of defending themselves. They must have been desperate to have made an attempt on such a formiddable foe.<br />
		<tab>Eventually the pack left, much fewer in number, and still just as hungry. The bears remained though, where the cubs, the two that had survived, nuzzled up to their bleeding mother. Despite our reason for being there, it was almost heartbreaking seeing her die, her great strength eventually giving out as she went limp.<br />
		<tab>Anna, ever the pragmatic, took that moment, as the young gorquithurs were wailing as they mourned, to rise up and throw his weighted net over the nearest one. Gerard was only a second behind her, a noose upon the end of a pole pulling the other cub away as it snapped at Mekhvitz. The Trchig, small blade in hand, gave each a quick slash, and his poison did the rest.<br />
		<tab>If I learnt anything from doing this favour for Reeth, it was that even young creatures can be a pain to drag through a wet-damned-forest."""
