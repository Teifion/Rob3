		After playing for a while or before you even start playing, you will probably have a brilliant idea on how the game could be better. Most games don't allow a high level of player involvement with the GM team and with good reason, can you imagine if Blizzard allowed players to dictate the rules of World of Warcraft? However the World of Arl is not like most other games and has several sections of the board devoted specifically to player feedback.

		<span class="stitle">Suggesting ideas</span><br />
		<img src="../../images/general/ideas.png" alt="Thought bubble ideas" width="90" height="90" style="float: right;"/>
		I listen to every single improvement suggestion that I can. I am interested in all suggestions, even if they mean that I'm doing a bad job right now. Upon getting the idea, stage 1 should be to ensure that you're sure of what the idea is, the last thing we need is for you to realise you've only half an idea (it's happened before) or for you to not be completely sure of what you mean.
		<br /><br />

		Stage 2 is to <a href="contact.php" title="Contact">get in contact</a> with me. Tell me about the idea and we'll take it from there. If you don't want to contact me over such personal methods such as IM or Email, you can post it to the "<a href="http://woarl.com/board/viewforum.php?f=39">Suggestion and Feedback</a>" section of the board and there it will be seen by both myself and other players.
		<br /><br />

		At all times I advise you to not rush and to think things through, the idea is crystal clear in your mind but that can be easily lost as you translate the idea into written text. Don't be put off if somebody completely misses the point of your idea, it just means that they've misunderstood or that you've missed something out.
		<br /><br />

		<?php
			echo addSubHeading('It is not all sunshine and happiness');

		Your idea may well be rejected but don't take it personally, I reject 95% of my own ideas. Keep coming up with ideas and sharing them, it may be that a combination of your ideas means that something else makes sense and some improvement can be made to the game that neither of us thought up to start with.
