		<tab>Finding the herd was no real trial, even for someone like me with only cursory knowledge of tracking, but then not being able to find any signs of something the size of a castle would be a feat in itself. They left a huge swath of destruction, with trees uprooted and the earth broken as if with a dozen ploughs of gargantuan proportions. The volume such a group of creatures must eat and drink could dwarf nations, and is ample explanation for their constant movement, lest they exhaust local supplies. I was fascinated to watch smaller herds and other animals eke out a living on the edge of such destruction, scavenging through upturned soil for food, or hiding in their recent passing from predators.<br />
		<tab>I might have thought it laughable for there to be a carnivore capable of bringing down one of the herd, but on one of our days we found a collosal corpse in the savaged grass, chunks of partly devoured meat scattered around it with scavengers picking at the remains. Whatever had brought it down had left its own tracks, a bloody path leading back towards some distant woodland far to the south. We did not sleep well that night.<br />
		<tab>When I first gazed out from a low rise and saw the herd of murdaphants it was as if I was upon a harbour and a fleet of ships was passing by, such was their size. Smaller animals were barely visible as little more than ants around their wide feet. We eventually closed the gap of miles, the huge herbivores now distinct shapes. How to describe such a beast? Would you start with the huge tusks of yellow ivory? Perhaps the layers of dirt caked within the crevasses of its skin's wrinkles? Maybe the maw of boulder-sized molars devouring tree and leaf alike. Whatever you might choose, I found myself going back to its collosal size time and time again; never before or since have I met a creature of such pure mass.<br />
		<tab>A map bought from some travelling group had found us the perfect spot for our plan, and we were fortunate that the herd that we shadowed was headed in that general direction. When the bull male at the front of its family, a terrifyingly huge beast that looked as if it could devour cities, started to lead the rest of them away from the trap, Anna would artfully craft an illusion to shun them aside, or reach into its tiny brain and lure it towards some whispered promise. It was truly quite a masterful way to move a lumbering idiot the way that she wanted it to go, but then I guess she's been doing that with Mekhvitz and Gerard for years now. Even with her guiding hand, it took weeks before we were close enough to put the plot into action, and I was glad to be able to say that we didn't see any further sign of their predator.<br />
		<tab>While the murdaphants grazed - tearing apart the ground and devouring bushes that must have stood for a score of years or more - we moved into position. Mekhvitz spoke of concerns with the plan, but I think that he was simply bitter that we weren't following his instructions for a catch, or maybe he resented the job that the pair of us had been given.<br />
		<tab>Gerard reached us at a sprint, sweating and breathing heavily, and silently signalled that his explosives were set. I still don't understand why he refuses to talk even when stealth isn't an issue; maybe as well as a Vow he has an Oath of Silence. Maybe I'll ask him someday. He must have set half a dozen of his munitions, a different amount of acid upon the soft clay cap of each, burning through even as we waited.<br />
		<tab>Our wait only lasted a moment longer, before there was a staccato of bangs not far from where the beasts grazed. The stampede formed quickly, the bull murdaphant rushing towards where Mekhvitz and I hid. Though I might not speak for my colleague, I was pleasantly surprised that they turned aside as we shouted and waved flaming branches over our heads. <br />
		<tab>The front half of the herd, bull and all, disappeared into the landscape. I wish I was being figurative, some flowery prose describing them running behind a rise or into a forest, but Anna pulled her illusion of an open vista away as a trickster - indeed as I might pull a tablecloth away from beneath a dinner set. The murdaphants were not left upright like such candlesticks would be though.<br />
		<tab>They stampeded over the cliff, almost howling as they recognised what their fate was to be, and plummeted to their cliff. With the illusion relinquished, and the cliff visible before them, the tail of the herd, those two old or young to run in the midst of such beasts, was left alone, for us to move onto Mekhvitz's plan, of systematic culling, tranquilising, and transporting. Dull details.<br />
		<tab>You know, it reminds me of a joke I once heard - Two murdaphants and a cymbal fall off a cliff..."""
